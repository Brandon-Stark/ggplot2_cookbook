Wilkelab ggplot2 cookbook
=========================
A document containing tips and tricks on using ggplot2 and on getting it to make plots look the way you want them to. Over time, hopefully this will become a useful resource.

You can see the properly rendered html version of the cookbook by  [clicking here.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/wilkelab/ggplot2_cookbook/blob/master/ggplot2_cookbook.html)

The R Markdown (.Rmd) source file that produced this document can be [seen here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilkelab/ggplot2_cookbook/master/ggplot2_cookbook.Rmd) As you can see, R Markdown is remarkably simply, and the html output is quite pretty. All you need to do to convert the .Rmd  file into the resulting html document is to load the .Rmd file into R Studio and click on `Knit HTML`.
